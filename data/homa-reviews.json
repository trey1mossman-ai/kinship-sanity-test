      "fullText": "This place is STUNNING!! It's such a cool spot to hang out in, I'm so surprised it wasn't packed when we went. The interior, the furniture, it's all perfectly designed and just a dream to be in. On top of that, they have amazing customer service and incredible food at really good prices. I got their med bowl and also ate part of a hand pie. The hand pie was to die for. Usually when you get this kind of thing the pastry is hard and not well made. At this place, the pastry was so good I would literally eat an entire plate of pie crust with no toppings. It was so light and just melts in your mouth. The fillings and sauces were amazing too. HIGHLY recommend this place!",

The food is high quality and healthier than typical. Great kombucha on tap, delicious fries, and the seating area is delightful, particularly during our house when you can easily have the place to yourself. I had the pork sandwich and my wife the salmon salad. Both were unique flavor profiles. Would visit again.",
